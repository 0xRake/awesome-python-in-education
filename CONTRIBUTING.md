# Contributing to Awesome Python in Education

You are here to help on Awesome Python in Education? Great, feel welcome and read the following sections in order to know what and how to work on something. If you get stuck at any point you can [create a ticket](https://github.com/quobit/awesome-python-in-education/issues/new).

### Tell them why they should read your guidelines.

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### Explain what kinds of contributions you are looking for.

Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions that mean less work for you.

> Elasticsearch is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Elasticsearch itself.

### Explain contributions you are NOT looking for (if any).

Again, defining this up front means less work for you. If someone ignores your guide and submits something you don’t want, you can simply close it and point to your policy.

> Please, don't use the issue tracker for [support questions]. Check whether the #pocoo IRC channel on Freenode can help with your issue. If your problem is not strictly Werkzeug or Flask specific, #python is generally more active. Stack Overflow is also worth considering.

# Ground Rules
### Set expectations for behavior (yours, and theirs).
This includes not just how to communicate with others (being respectful, considerate, etc) but also technical responsibilities (importance of testing, project dependencies, etc). Mention and link to your code of conduct, if you have one.

> Responsibilities
* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
